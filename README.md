# Solo Challenge
## Social impact

For this project I chose to make a website for the vzw Hondenboot Antwerpen. Their website is a little outdated and in desperate need for a new breath of life, which is what I'm hoping to provide for them.


## What is Hondenboot Antwerpen.

Hondenboot Antwerpen is a non profit organisation that trains service dogs to aid the people that could use a service dog by their side, they also take care of the placement of the dogs. Unfortunately the non profit part of their organisation is quickly spotted in their website, take a look [here](http://www.antwerpsehulphonden.be/). This gave me the motivation to try and make an improved version of their outdated website.
